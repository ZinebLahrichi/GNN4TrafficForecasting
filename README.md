### Create new environment

The project is configured to use the `mlns` conda environment which is described in `environment.yml`. To install it,
open a terminal in the project root directory and run the following:

```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then setup a new interpreter in the interpreter settings of PyCharm from the newly created conda environment
named `mlns`.

### Add new dependencies

#### Updating your conda environment when new dependencies are added to environment.yml

```bash
$ conda env update -f environment.yml  --prune
```

#### Updating the environment.yml file when you need new dependencies

```bash
$ conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
```

Then delete the last line in environment.yml with the prefix.
